% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,

%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

\title{An Empirical Assessment of the Adoption of Java Generics and Lambda Expressions} 

% \subtitle{[Extended Abstract]
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{8} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\section{Overview}

\subsection{Generics}
In 2004 Sun Microsystems introduced generics in benefit to remove ambiguity in collections like not specify the type and not doing so much cast in the collections.
Elimination of casts. The following code snippet without generics requires casting:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("hello");
String s = (String) list.get(0);
\end{lstlisting}

When re-written to use generics, the code does not require casting:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
list.add("hello");
String s = list.get(0);   // no cast
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Lambda}
	Like intent to help write a better code \textit{Java 8}. A significantly change focus in Collection API with addition of \textit{Streams} that allow us to write a better code about collections-processing at a hight level of abstraction. A good solution provide for \textit{Stream} is a trouble about concurrency that solve this with simple loops for and while was necessary a hard work and many boilerplate while \textit{parallelStream} is a elegant way to this.\\
	
	The difference between \textit{Collection} and \textit{Stream} is that \textit{Collection} is an data structure in memory while \textit{Stream}is a conceptually fixed data structure that computed elements by demand. When we using \textit{Collection Interface} require iteration provide by user while \textit{Stream Interface} uses internal iteration. Such as real example extracted Jetty 9.3.0:\\

	\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
	List<String> actual = new ArrayList<>(); 
	for (Path path:finder.getHits()){
	 actual.add(hb.toShortForm(path.toFile()));
	}
	
	List<String> actual = finder.getHits().stream().map(hb.toShortForm(Path::toFile)).collect(toList());
	
	for(String parent:module.getParentNames()){
	 System.out.printf("Depend:%s%n",parent);
	}
	
	module.getParentNames().stream().forEach(parent->System.out.printf("Depend:%s%n",parent));
\end{lstlisting}

Based in this examples we have interested to research cases like this to find real opportunities of refactoring to prove that a adoption lambda expression in Java projects wold be a simple way to re-write a code and discovery if community has adopted Lambda to create a better code.\\
Like this we have 2 questions about lambda to guide this work:
\textbf{RQ1:} How was adoption of Lambda by the community?\\
\textbf{RQ2:} There are any construction with Lambda in a projects?\\




\section{Investigation}

\subsection{Projects studied}

We choose 27 open source projects with the last public release in 2015. Here are we choose \textit{Ant}, \textit{Hibernate orm}, \textit{Openmeetings}, \textit{Tomcat}, \textit{Archiva}, \textit{Jclouds}, \textit{Platform Community}, \textit{UniversalMediaServer}, \textit{Bonita-Tools}, \textit{Jenkins},\textit{Postgree jdbc}, \textit{Wicket},\textit{Cassandra}, \textit{Jmeter}, \textit{Sonar}, \textit{Wildfly},\textit{Checkstyle}, \textit{Log4j}, \textit{Spark}, \textit{Woden}, \textit{Crawler4j} ,\textit{Maven}, \textit{Spring}, \textit{Zookeeper},\textit{Eclipse}, \textit{MyFaces} and \textit{Storm} we choose this because are constantly update and has a large adoption on open source community.\\ 


%We choose 6 open source projects, \textit{Hibernate}, \textit{Jasper}, \textit{JBPM JBoss}, \textit{Jetty}, \textit{Tomcat} and \textit{Maven}, that has large adoption and contribution inside the open source community. All these projects have many releases and large historic of updates that possibility a deep analysis to investigation in view of the releases followed by all features that was appeared in Java language.



\subsection{Methodology}
We start doing static analyzing in all \textit{.java} files in open source projects that we choose, to collected data around how often the community generics and lambda expressions at the time was generated an AST to each file source. Based on structure and abstraction provided from Eclipse JDT we choose this API to support generates a parse tree to each file and creation of each visitor \cite{Gamma:1995:DPE:186897}. We choose to use the framework Spring to inject the visitors such as dependence. Therefore like an ideal configuration in visitor \cite{Gamma:1995:DPE:186897} when found a ideal construction as base from this paper, this is save to analysis with R language \cite{R}.\\

The Static Analyses has a visitor to search  Lambda Expression because we have a intent to discovery how community has been accepted this feature so waited. Another hand, we cant leave explain how community has ignored an opportunity to make a simple refactoring in large scale when not use Lambda to replace a Enhanced For to iterate a Collection. Like it each occur of Lambda Expression and Enhanced For are save in a csv file to analysis marking source file and line of start and project name end of each construction founded.\\
  

\section{Results}

\subsection{Lambda}
After analysis around 3.5M LOC, we founded 438 cases to Lambda inside unit test. We concluded that a large use in unit test probability because developers work with anonymous methods provide for Lambda and to increase a productive and isn't necessary create methods to make tests.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth]{lambdaTest}
	\label{fig:testsLambda}
	\caption{Use of Lambda in unit tests.}
\end{figure}

Another relevant point is that developers ignore a real opportunities to refactoring iteration in Collections with Stream and prefer use \textit{Enhanced For} to do it. In this research we founded 18821 cases in 23 projects to convert \textit{Enhanced For} to \textit{Stream} interface provide that avoid some boilerplate and open opportunities to do concurrency in Collections through \textbf{parallelStream}, in figure ~\ref{fig:opportunitiesLambda} occur about Enhanced.\\

	\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{lamdaOpport}
	\label{fig:opportunitiesLambda}
	\caption{Oportunites to replace For by Lambda.}
\end{figure}




\section{Future work}
Generics ????\\

Maybe with a large adoption of community for lambda become possible the the use of language Scale was increased. However that a paradigm function was incorporated in Java and was a good work discovery if it can replace constructors in Scala. Another point is that Lambda provide solution more elegant to concurrency in a loop avoid boilerplate and generated a construct more clear but the big problems is how test Lambda Expression with a elegant form showed this construction are anonymous methods. \\

\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
document in Appendix-appropriate form:
\subsection{Introduction}

\subsection{References}
Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
the .tex source file and comment out
the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
