Modernizing legacy systems towards the evolution 
of the underlining programming language has been reported as 
a challenging task. For this reason, developers often prefer to maintain 
the use of existing constructs instead of using new language 
features. This scenario of language evolution might be well exemplified 
using two remarkable releases of Java programming language--- Java SE 5.0 (2004) 
and Java SE 8 (2014), for instance, in which considerable language 
improvements were proposed. Java SE 5.0 introduced parametric polymorphism to the language (using Java Generics) and Java SE 8 introduced Lambda Expressions. In this paper we empirically investigate the adoption of both features by considering 
open-source Java systems. In the case of Java Generics, differently 
from existing reasearch works, we compare the adoption of this 
language feature by considering two distinct groups. In the first group we 
only consider systems whose initial development 
started before the release of Java SE 5.0. In the second group we consider systems whose initial development started at least five years after the release of Java 
SE 5.0. In the case of Lambda Expressions, we contribute as one the first attempts to empirically characterize  the common usage of that language construct. Our results reveal that\ldots
